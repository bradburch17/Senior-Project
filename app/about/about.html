                <p>
                    This website was designed by Brad Burch for his senior seminar project in the Fall of 2016. My inspiration was from running Cross Counry and Track and Field at DePauw University, where they used an outdated website, called <a href="http://www.logarun.com">LogARun</a>.
                    The purpose of this website is to create a new activity logging website with wearable technology integration. This website will feature FitBit integration, although a further application of this idea would include integration from
                    GPS technology and oher wearable technologies. Even further applications of this website may also include better logging for non-distance athletes, such as sprinters, and graphical analysis of runs. For more information about what
                    could be improved upon, you can email me at joggersandloggers@gmail.com.

                <p>
                    I am Brad Burch, a Senior Computer Science major at DePauw University. I run Cross Country and Track and Field at DePauw University, where I developed the idea to make this website. I am from Rochester, Indiana, which is a small town in north-central
                    Indiana. In my past, I have done 6 triathlons and have a passion to continue exercising after graduation. After graduation I am moving to San Francisco to work as an Associate Software Engineer at Salesforce, specifically in their
                    Internet of Things Cloud. While there, I hope to possibly attend graduate school for Computer Science and receive a Masters Degree. In all honesty, I'm just excited to go further west than Wisconsin for once in my life and make friends
                    with a dolphin.
