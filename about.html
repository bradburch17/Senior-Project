					<h4><b>About the Website</b></h4>
					<p>
						This website was designed by Brad Burch for his senior seminar project in the Fall of 2016. My inspiration was from running Cross Counry and Track and Field at DePauw University, where they used an outdated website, called <a href="http://www.logarun.com">LogARun</a>. The purpose of this website is to create a new activity logging website
						with wearable technology integration. This website will feature FitBit integration, although a further application of this idea would include integration from GPS technology and oher wearable technologies. Even further applications of this website may also include better logging for non-distance athletes, such as sprinters, and graphical
						analysis of runs. For more information about what could be improved upon, you can email me at bradburch77@gmail.com.

					<h4><b>About The Programmer</b></h4>
					<p>
						I am Brad Burch, a Senior Computer Science major at DePauw University. I run Cross Country and Track and Field at DePauw University, where I developed the idea to make this website. I am from Rochester, Indiana, which is a small farm town in northern-central Indiana. In my past, I have done 6 triathlons and have a passion to continue
						exercising after graduation. After graduation I am moving to San Francisco to work as an Associate Software Engineer at Salesforce, specifically in their Internet of Things Cloud. While there, I hope to possibly attend graduate school for Computer Science and recieve a Masters Degree. In all honesty, I'm just excited to go further
						west than Wisconsin for once in my life and make friends with a dolphin.
